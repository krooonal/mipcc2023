Limit the number of solutions to 5
Add last 5 solutions and one common solution (0.9 similarity)
No more eventhandler
stop 2 seconds before timeout (time penalty worse than gap penalty)
(big effect expected) var history set pseudocost count to 4

Revert the no solution part
Solution hiniting is now a parameter. Impact factor 0.8
--- 26 dec full ---
Solution hiniting Impact factor 0.7
maxcuts impact factor 0.7

Don't update scores for the first instance.
Force attempt all values till count 5 in parameters

New branching rule. 20% with 0.9 cost_update_factor
Fix penalty on unsuccessful hint. (remove heuristic time from penalty)
hint success stats
--- 29 dec full ---
Remove variable from hint if value is out of bounds.
New rule: Only update count of last level branching var when updating costs.
Hinting: Update true score only if the hint was successful. Update the other score otherwise.
EXP: branching rule 100%
EXP: Always provide Solns
EXP: Always add cuts
