after 22 dec full
Limit the number of solutions to 5
Add last 5 solutions and one common solution (0.9 similarity)
No more eventhandler
stop 2 seconds before timeout (time penalty worse than gap penalty)
(big effect expected) var history set pseudocost count to 4
--- 25 dec full ---
Provide no solution
--- 26 dec small10 ---
Revert the no solution part
Solution hiniting is now a parameter. Impact factor 0.8
--- 26 dec full ---
Solution hiniting Impact factor 0.7
maxcuts impact factor 0.7
--- 27 dec full ---
Don't update scores for the first instance.
Force attempt all values till count 5 in parameters
--- 28 dec full ---
New branching rule. 20% with 0.9 cost_update_factor
Fix penalty on unsuccessful hint. (remove heuristic time from penalty)
hint success stats
--- 29 dec full ---
Remove variable from hint if value is out of bounds.
New rule: Only update count of last level branching var when updating costs.
New rule: Two way pscost updates. 
New rule: No history reset. Threshold for reliability is 40.
Hinting: Update true score only if the hint was successful. Update the other score otherwise.
New branching rule. 20% with 0.9 cost_update_factor

--- 10 jan full ---
Levelpscost different implementation.
--- 11 jan full ---
Turn off levelpscost.

Use mt19937 for random number generation in param tuning.
--- 15 jan full 2---
Recompile scip without levelpscost added code.
--- 16 jan full ---
switch to pscost after index 4
--- 16 jan full 2---
(if only lhs/rhs has changed) switch to pscost after index 4
Explore without randomness (explore count 8)
Tune cuts after index 4


TODOs
if only obj change -> history reset to 1
go back to faster tuning?
Max restarts as parameter 0,1
