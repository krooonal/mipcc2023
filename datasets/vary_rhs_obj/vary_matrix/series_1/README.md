# MIPcc23: The MIP Workshop 2023 Computational Competition

This directory contains one series of 50 related mixed-integer programs built from a common formulation with varying input data.

## Properties of the Instance Series

- Number of variables: 802 (500 binary and 302 continuous)
- Number of constraints: 531
- Varying components: constraint coefficients for 500 constraints
- Each of these 500 constraints contain one binary variable along with continuous variables, i.e., the binary variables form a diagonal structure
