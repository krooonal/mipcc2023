# mipcc2023

Code for MIP computational competition 2023 (C++).

The execution file mipcomp.sh already has commands to compile the code if the code is not compiled.

The compiled code is in cppcode/build directory.

Use experiment.cpp file for any experimental evaluation. Modify the mipcomp.sh accordingly.

Ignore the python code. It is strictly for analysis and comparision. It is not used for the competition.
